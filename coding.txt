1.Absract:
  The Password Generation System is a software application designed to generate strong and secure passwords automatically. 
  Strong passwords are essential for protecting user accounts from unauthorized access. This system creates random passwords 
  using a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The generated passwords are 
  difficult to guess and improve overall security. The project can be implemented using programming languages

2.Itroduction:
 the rapid growth of digital systems, securing user accounts has become very important. Weak passwords can be easily hacked 
 using brute force or dictionary attacks. Therefore, generating strong and random passwords is necessary. The Password Generation 
System helps users create secure passwords instantly without manual effort

3.Methodology
 *The system follows these steps:
 *User enters the desired password length
 *System selects random characters from:
 *Uppercase letters
 *Lowercase letters
 *Numbers
 *Special symbols
 *System combines the characters randomly
 *System displays the generated password

4.coding:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {
    int length, i;
    
    // Character set: lowercase, uppercase, digits, special characters
    char charset[] = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
                     "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
                     "0123456789"
                     "!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:,.<>?";

    int charsetSize = sizeof(charset) - 1;  // Exclude null terminator

    printf("Enter desired password length: ");
    scanf("%d", &length);

    // Seed random number generator
    srand(time(NULL));

    printf("Generated Password: ");

    for(i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        int index = rand() % charsetSize;
        printf("%c", charset[index]);
    }

    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}

5. Features
 *User can enter password length
 *Generates random password
 *Uses letters, numbers, symbols
 *Simple and easy UI
